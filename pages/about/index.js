      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        From patient care to building websites, my journey has been anything but
        conventional. As a physical therapist who discovered a passion for code,
        I bring a unique perspective to web development that combines analytical
        thinking with creative problem-solving.
      </p>
      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        During my time in patient care, which included attending physical
        therapy school during the pandemic, I gained profound insights into
        healthcare accessibility and equity. While I loved helping patients
        recover and regain their independence, I discovered I wanted to make
        contributions in other ways and decided to pursue a role in technology.
        Now, I'm on an exciting journey of self-taught full stack web
        development. The problem-solving nature of coding reminds me of
        designing treatment plans - each solution is unique to the situation at
        hand, requiring both creativity and analytical thinking.
      </p>
      <h2>Life Beyond Code</h2>
      <p>When I'm not immersed in code, you'll likely find me:</p>
      <h3> Exploring Food:</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an enthusiastic foodie with a notorious sweet tooth. While desserts
        hold a special place in my heart, I appreciate all cuisines and believe
        that great food is about more than just taste - it's about the
        experience and the joy of sharing memorable meals with good company.
      </p>
      <h3>Lost in Books:</h3>
      <p>
        Reading has been a constant companion throughout my life, recently
        rediscovered during my career transition. I gravitate towards fantasy
        and character-driven narratives that offer meaningful storytelling and
        emotional depth. Some favorites include the <i>Percy Jackson</i> series,{" "}
        <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, and{" "}
        <i>Emily Wilde's Encyclopedia of Faeries</i>.
      </p>
      <h3>Crafting & Creating:</h3>
      <p>
        Crocheting has become my newest adventure. There's something deeply
        calming about focusing on the rhythmic motion of creating something by
        hand. It's become my perfect way to unwind, especially when paired with
        my favorite shows.
      </p>
      <h3>Wandering the World:</h3>
      <p>
        Whether exploring the tulip fields of Amsterdam, vineyard-dotted hills
        of Italy, vibrant streets of Japan, or discovering local gems in my
        hometown, I love immersing myself in different cultures through their
        food, traditions, and daily life.
      </p>
      <h3>Professional Philosophy</h3>
      <p>
        While I've chosen to transition from healthcare to the tech space, my
        experiences have made me deeply aware of the inequities that exist in
        our society. As I build my career in technology, I hope to make
        meaningful contributions and advocate for a more accessible and
        equitable environment, regardless of the specific path my journey takes.
        I'm currently immersed in expanding my development skills, focusing on
        building inclusive and user-friendly applications. I approach each
        project with dedication and attention to detail, always striving to
        create solutions that make a positive impact.
