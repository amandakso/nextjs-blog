While exploring the world of crochet projects, I've discovered the concept of temperature blankets, where each row represents daily weather throughout the year. Among the creative variations of temperature blankets I've discovered, many crocheters have designed 'book blankets' to represent their reading journeys. Inspired by these projects - which use various approaches to capture books through yarn - I've planned my own version for 2025. I've carefully planned the details to set myself up for success.

The blanket will represent each book's genre through different colors, with the number of rows determined by page count. I've chosen the lovely [farmhouse blanket pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir_G9IX5P64) by The Turtle Trunk, which uses an even moss stitch (alternating slip stitch and half double crochet) with a crab stitch border. Though the crab stitch will be new to me, I'm confident I can master it with practice. Worse case scenario, even without the border, the pattern stands beautifully on its own.
Using the suggested yarn in the blanket pattern, Lion Brand Color Theory Yarn, I created the following genre color scheme to create an earthy neutral and jewel tone color palette:

- Fantasy: Thunder
- Romance: Himalayan Salt
- Literary Fiction/Other Fiction: Canyon
- Historical Fiction: Stonewash
- Sci-fi/Dystopian: Peacock
- Mystery/Thriller/Horror: Raisin
- Manga/Graphic Novels: Amethyst
- Nonfiction: Bone
- Monthly Separators/Border: Moonbeam

For my twin-sized blanket requiring 340 rows, I've developed a page-count system based on my typical reading pace of approximately 100 books per year:

- Books of 350 pages or less: 2 rows
- 351-499 pages: 4 rows
- 500-699 pages: 6 rows
- 700+ pages: 8 rows
- Plus 2 rows of separator color between months

To stay on track, I'll maintain a progress log after each book and aim for 28-30 rows monthly, with quarterly check-ins. While this first major project feels ambitious, I'm excited to combine my love of reading and crochet into a meaningful, tangible creation.
