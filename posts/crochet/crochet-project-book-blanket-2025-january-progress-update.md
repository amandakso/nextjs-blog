My ambitious 2025 book blanket project started with some humbling lessons - namely, that I apparently can't count to 200! The pattern calls for a chain of 207 stitches for a twin-sized blanket, requiring an odd number per row. The number of times I disappointedly ended on an even stitch (half double crochet instead of a slip stitch) reached embarrassingly into double digits. I even made it to row two once before realizing the count was off, stubbornly frogging the whole thing to restart. Lesson learned: next time, don't undo the chains completely - just add or subtract a couple to get the count right. I was also making the chains too tight at times, which became a pain when starting the foundation row.

Through all this chain-counting drama, I discovered there's actually a technique that combines the foundation chain with the first row - where was this knowledge when I started? While it's too late for this project, I'm definitely keeping this method in my back pocket for future projects. It seems like it could save both time and the headache of counting endless chains!

Eventually, I settled for 205 stitches per row. While not the exact 207 called for, it was still an odd number, and the blanket width looked acceptable. I couldn't face another restart! After this rough beginning, things smoothed out considerably. One saving grace of the pattern is that the slip stitches and half double crochets are visually distinct, eliminating the need for constant counting. This allows for enjoyable multitasking - watching TV, listening to audiobooks or podcasts. Sometimes I just focus on the crocheting alone, finding it relaxing and meditative.
Towards the month's end, I did some stitch counting to verify my progress - still holding steady at 205 per row! While I'd been eyeballing the width as I went along, actually counting provided welcome reassurance. After January, I tackled weaving in most of my color-change ends. Unfortunately, I crocheted one of the earlier ends too tightly, creating a slight pinch in that row's width. Another lesson learned: maintain consistent tension when weaving. Hopefully, some blocking and the final border will help disguise this.

Most of my January reads were fantasy (shocking, I know). While I had anticipated a lot of thunder-colored sections in my blanket due to my reading preferences, I didn't realize when creating my genre color palette just how dark the thunder yarn would be. I'm curious to see how my chosen color palette develops. Even if the final color combination isn't conventional, seeing the meaningful connection between the colors and my reading journey should make the blanket special.

At January's end, I'm counting this as a success - still committed to the project and roughly on track with 26 rows completed. Not bad for a month of counting challenges!
