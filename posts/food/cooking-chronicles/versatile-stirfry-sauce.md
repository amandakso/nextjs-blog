I'm a big proponent of versatility in cooking. Being able to utilize simple recipes for multiple purposes can make weeknight cooking both easier and more enjoyable. Recently, while planning a tofu stir-fry dinner, I found myself without a go-to sauce recipe. After browsing Pinterest, I discovered a promising [brown sauce recipe](https://beyondthenoms.com/brown-sauce-chinese-takeout/) from Beyond the Noms that I adapted for a single meal.
The beauty of this sauce lies in its adaptability - it works wonderfully with any protein and vegetable combination you have on hand. While I paired it with tofu, broccoli, and red bell peppers, it would be equally delicious with chicken, pork, or beef, and vegetables like snap peas, mushrooms, or string beans.

## Stir-fry Sauce Recipe

Adapted from Beyond the Noms

### Ingredients (single meal portion):

_These measurements are approximations to what I used while making the recipe_

- 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 Tbsp Mirin
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tsp corn starch

### Cooking Process

The preparation couldn't be simpler. I whisked together all ingredients except the cornstarch until well combined. Just before adding to the stir-fry, I incorporated the cornstarch and poured the mixture over my nearly-finished dish, cooking for a few additional minutes on medium heat until the sauce thickened to the perfect consistency.

### My Results and Notes

For my dinner, I served the sauce over a stir-fry of crispy tofu, tender-crisp broccoli, and sweet red bell peppers, all atop a bed of steamed rice. The sauce came out slightly sweeter than expected - while thoroughly enjoyable, I have some modifications in mind for next time:

#### Potential Modifications:

Reduce the sugar/Mirin combination, or substitute Mirin with Shaoxing wine (as in the original recipe)
Consider sake or dry cooking sherry as alternative substitutes
Add minced ginger, garlic, and/or scallions for additional depth of flavor

This sauce has earned a permanent spot in my weeknight dinner rotation. It's quick to prepare, adaptable to whatever ingredients I have on hand, and delivers that satisfying restaurant-style finish to any stir-fry. Sometimes the simplest recipes become the most reliable kitchen allies.
