I'm a big proponent of versalitility in cooking. Being able to utilize simple recipes for multiple uses and purposes and stretching out their use can make cooking easier. Recently I wanted to find a simple weekday dinner meal. The plan was to make a tofu stirfry. Stirfrys can be quite versalite, using whatever preferences for meat, veggies, and sauce. While I knew what source of protein and vegetables I would use for this meal, it had been a while since I made a similar dish and had no sauce recipe on hand. Browsing Pinterest, I found this [brown sauce](https://beyondthenoms.com/brown-sauce-chinese-takeout/) recipe from Beyond the Noms and chose to utilize it for my dish. While her recipe is for a batch sauce that can be stored for future use, I decide to proportion the recipe for a single use and chose the sauce ingredients from her list that I wished to add and had on hand.
Sauce Recipe (inspired by Beyond the Noms)

Ingredients: (approximations)

- 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 Tbsp Mirin
- 1 Tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tsp corn starch

Cooking Experience
I added all the ingredients besides the cornstarch together and whisked together. Right before I was ready to add the dish on the stovetop, I added the cornstarch to the sauce and mixed it in, then added to the dish on medium heat. Cooked for a couple of minutes while the sauce thickened and mixed together the sauce and stirfry. It was a bit on the sweet side, while perfectly enjoyable I would probably use a combination of less sugar/Mirin or substitue Mirin for Shaoxing wine as was the original ingredient in the recipe (could also substitute sake or dry cooking sherry). I could also add some minced ginger, garlic and/or scallions for additional flavor. This sauce is super simple to make and add wonderful flavor to a stir fry dish. I'm planning to use this or a variation of this to my arsenal for when I need to make a quick and simple meal.
