What else is there to write about in a first blog post other than an introduction? Not very original but serves its purpose. So, here we go:

I'm a physical therapist who's made the leap into fullstack web development. While my days are now filled with code instead of patient care, my free time revolves around my favorite hobbies: books, food, crochet, and travel.

You'll likely find me curled up with a fantasy novel - there's nothing quite like getting lost in intricate worlds and magic systems. While fantasy is my go-to genre, I'm always trying to diversify my reading. I have a soft spot for mysteries and coming-of-age stories that pull you into their world.

When it comes to food, I'm always on the hunt for new flavors. I have a major sweet tooth (I'm definitely scanning the dessert menu first), but what really catches my attention is food that's both a feast for the eyes and the palate. As the saying goes, phone eats first! You might find me attempting new recipes in my kitchen or seeking out local restaurants that provide the perfect comfort.

Travel is still a largely unwritten chapter in my story, but I'm eager to change that. Whether it's exploring a nearby place or dreaming of far-off destinations, I'm drawn to experiencing new cultures, wandering around taking in the sites, and of course, sampling the local cuisine.

In between all of this, you might catch me fumbling with yarn and a crochet hook, trying to create something that resembles what I saw on Pinterest. It's a hobby that perfectly balances my technical day job with something creative and tangible.

This blog is where these pieces of my life will come together - a space to document my adventures in reading, eating, traveling, crafting, and more, no matter how big or small they might be.
