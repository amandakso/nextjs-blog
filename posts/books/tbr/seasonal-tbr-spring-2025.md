As I curated my spring reading list, I noticed a compelling theme emerging among my choices: stories of overcoming adversity and exploring the human condition. With spring being a season of rebirth and renewal, I found myself drawn to books that promise both heartwarming moments and emotional depth. I'm excited to share what I plan to read over the next three months, and hopefully discover some new favorites along the way!

### Spring TBR List

#### _A Psalm for the Wild-Built_ by Becky Chambers

This wholesome, philosophical sci-fi promises a unique story about the unlikely friendship between a robot and a tea monk. The premise alone captures the essence of what I'm seeking this spring - thoughtful narratives that warm the heart.

#### _The God of the Woods_ by Liz Moore

As the 2024 Goodreads Choice Award winner for Mystery/Thriller, this literary suspense novel spans generations, following the disappearance of a daughter from her family's summer camp - made more mysterious by her older brother's vanishing years before. I'm curious to see if this acclaimed novel will resonate with me as it has with so many readers.

#### _Jade City_ by Fonda Lee

The beginning of an urban fantasy series centered around a powerful gang family, this novel promises complex family dynamics woven into a rich fantasy world. I'm particularly excited to see how Lee balances family relationships with urban fantasy elements.

#### _Water Moon_ by Samantha Sotto Yambao

A whimsical and mystical cozy fantasy about a daughter who inherits a pawnshop where people can sell their regrets. The premise alone captures my imagination, and I'm looking forward to exploring this unique concept.

#### _The Housekeeper and the Professor_ by Yoko Ogawa

This Japanese translated work weaves mathematics and equations into a tender story about the relationship between a math professor with short-term memory and his housekeeper. I've heard wonderful things about how it transforms mathematical concepts into metaphors for human connection.

#### _Howl's Moving Castle_ by Diana Wynne Jones

The beloved novel that inspired the Studio Ghibli film feels like the perfect whimsical spring read. I'm excited to experience the original story that captured so many hearts.

#### _Land of Milk and Honey_ by C Pam Zhang

Part of my 25 books in 2025, this literary dystopian novel promises to be a love letter to food. The combination of literary fiction and dystopian elements, centered around cuisine, feels uniquely compelling.

#### _Shark Heart_ by Emily Habeck

Another selection from my 25 books in 2025 list, this emotional story follows a husband diagnosed with a condition that gradually transforms him into a shark. I've heard it's a powerful metaphor for caring for loved ones with degenerative diseases, promising both tears and profound insights into love and loss.

#### _The Warm Hands of Ghosts_ by Katherine Arden

Known for her lyrical prose, Arden's latest is a standalone World War I story told through dual perspectives, following a nurse searching for her supposedly deceased brother. The combination of historical fiction, family bonds, and Arden's writing style makes this a highly anticipated read.

Looking at this list, I'm struck by how each book approaches transformation and renewal in its own unique way - from literal metamorphosis to emotional growth, from healing old wounds to forging new connections. It feels perfectly aligned with the spirit of spring, and I can't wait to dive in.
