2025 kicked off with a mix of reading experiences that pushed me outside my comfort zone, though with disappointing results. While some books didn't quite hit the mark, there were definitely some enjoyable reads.

Julie Leong's _The Teller of Small Fortunes_ started my year on a high note, delivering a delightfully cozy fantasy experience. My favorite read of the month was Leigh Bardugo's _Six of Crows_ (one of my 25 books in 2025), which captivated me with its found family dynamics and engaging heist story. Having watched the Shadow and Bone Netflix adaptation actually proved helpful, giving me a solid foundation in the Grishaverse before diving into this spinoff duology.

The month, however, had its disappointments. While I generally enjoyed continuing the Veronica Speedwell series with _A Perilous Undertaking_, its use of yellowface was problematic and significantly impacted my rating. Similarly, a Pride and Prejudice-inspired Asian American romance (_A Taste for Love_) which premise promised to be my cup of tea, didn't quite live up to expectations.

Looking ahead to February, I'm excited to return to my reading comfort zone with several anticipated fantasy titles on deck.

#### Book Ratings & Mini Reviews

- _The Teller of Small Fortunes_ by Julie Leong (4/5 ⭐):
  > An Asian-inspired charming cozy fantasy with wholesome found family
- _The Ten Thousand Doors of January_ by Alix E. Harrow (2/5 ⭐):
  > While the prose is undeniably beautiful, the story falls flat with a messy plot and frustrating characters who seem perpetually surprised by obvious revelations. The fascinating premise of doors to other worlds feels disappointingly underutilized, never reaching its full potential.
- _An Academy for Liars_ by Alexis Henderson (2/5 ⭐):
  > An intriguing premise that ultimately disappoints. Despite promising setup, the story suffers from unsatisfying resolution and an insufferable protagonist whose plot armor stretches credibility.
- _Spy x Family Volume #13_ by Tatsuya Endo(n/a):
  > While I don't rate manga volumes individually, this series continues to charm and I thoroughly enjoyed reading volume #13.
- _Six of Crows_ by Leigh Bardugo(4.5/5 ⭐):
  > First book in the Six of Crows duology. A well crafted heist story featuring a compelling ragtag team of criminals. The found family dynamics and intricate plot had me hooked from start to finish.
- _A Perilous Undertaking_ by Deanna Raybourn (2.5/5 ⭐):
  > Second book in the Veronica Speedwell series. While the regency era murder mystery and witty banter with Stoker should shine, the book is unfortunately marred by its problematic use of yellowface, which overshadows its better elements.
- _Killer Instinct_ by Jennifer Lynn Barnes (3/5 ⭐):
  > Second installment in the Naturals series. While it lacks the fresh appeal of the first book, it remains a quick and engaging thriller. The flaws become more apparent, but it's still an entertaining read.
- _A Taste for Love_ by Jennifer Yen (2.75/5 ⭐):

  > A Pride and Prejudice retelling that promises a baking competition but doesn't deliver until halfway through. Suffers from cartoonish characterization and romantic leads lacking chemistry. The baking elements, when they finally appear, aren't enough to save it.

### Lines I Loved

**From _The Teller of Small Fortunes_**

> "Everyone deserves a home, Tao thought, patting Laohu's whiskery grey nose. And what was a home but somewhere you wouldn't have to feel quite so alone?"

**From _The Ten Thousand Doors of January_**

> "There's only one way to run away from your own story, and that's to sneak into someone else's."

**From _Six of Crows_**

> "'Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you'll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet. And even if he is too poor to give you any of them, it won't matter because he will have taken the time to know you as no one else does.'"

> "The heart is an arrow. It demands aim to land true. She clung to the wall, but it was purpose she grasped at long last, and that carried her upward."

> “’The life you live, the hate you feel— it’s poison. I can drink it no longer.”

**From _A Perilous Undertaking_**

> "I have a gift for debauchery. It is why I have largely given it up. There is no real thrill in sinning when one has a talent for it."

> "I have not spoken of it. I may never. But when I do, it will be with you."
