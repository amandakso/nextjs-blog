February was a stellar reading month featuring three 5-star reads that exceeded my expectations. M.L. Wang's standalone fantasy _Sword of Kaigen_ captivated me with its elemental magic system, intense combat scenes, and moving family dynamics. Martha Wells' _All Systems Red_ and Robin Hobb's _Assassin's Apprentice_ lived up to their anticipation, cementing themselves as new favorites. Yangsze Choo's _The Fox Wife_ nearly reached perfection at 4.5 stars, leaving me enchanted long after finishing. In the spirit of Valentine's Day, I explored romance with mixed results—Abby Jimenez's Yours Truly delivered, while Susan Lee's Seoulmates disappointed. Despite a few misses, February significantly outshined January with multiple new favorite reads already secured for the year!

#### February's Literary Expedition: Field Notes

_The Fox Wife_ by Yangsze Choo (4.5/5 ⭐):  
Absolutely obsessed with this enchanting story centered on Chinese fox folklore. While the dual POV narrative occasionally slowed the pacing, I became completely absorbed in this atmospheric winter fantasy. The exploration of grief and healing resonated deeply, and though the plot was somewhat predictable, I can't imagine the story unfolding any other way. A near-perfect standalone that's made for curling up with during the winter months.

_The Sword of Kaigen_ by M.L. Wang (5/5 ⭐):  
This standalone fantasy completely swept me away with its masterful blend of elemental magic, political intrigue, and deeply emotional character relationships. Following a mother and son whose lives are upended by invasion, it delivers far more than a simple war story. Despite some unresolved plot points, I was utterly captivated—- my favorite read of the month!

_Sweet Bean Paste_ by Durian Sukegawa (2.75/5 ⭐):  
Despite an intriguing premise and food-centered narrative, this story left me underwhelmed. The characters and plot failed to resonate, possibly due to translation issues. Despite its relatively short length, the pacing dragged considerably. What should have been a poignant exploration of human connection instead left me emotionally disengaged from both the characters and their struggles.

_Seoulmates_ by Susan Lee (2/5 ⭐):  
A severe disappointment despite promising an Asian American-centered contemporary second chance romance. The main character was frustratingly unlikable, and even accounting for it being YA, the narrative felt immature and lacked emotional depth. What could have been a sweet, culturally rich romance became a frustrating example of squandered potential.

_All Systems Red_ by Martha Wells (5/5 ⭐):  
I love Murderbot! Surprisingly relatable and humorous, I connected with its antisocial tendencies and dry wit. This novella about a security unit that hacked its own governor module just so it could watch television shows was an absolute delight. Murderbot's awkward interactions with its human crew provide both comedy and unexpected depth. Already looking forward to continuing the series.

_Assassin's Apprentice_ by Robin Hobb (5/5 ⭐):  
An incredible start to a highly anticipated series. Hobb's intricate worldbuilding left me eager to discover more as the series progresses. This slower-paced, character-driven fantasy still delivers emotional impact with an engaging plot. The relationships and political machinations are masterfully crafted, making this a standout beginning to what promises to be an epic journey.

_Yours Truly_ by Abby Jimenez (4/5 ⭐):  
A charming romance with excellent chemistry between the main characters. Their mutual care and compatibility shone throughout the story. While the plot occasionally felt overloaded with tropes and the healthcare setting contained some distracting inaccuracies, I enjoyed this significantly more than the first book in these interconnected standalones. A solid Valentine's month read.

_All In_ by Jennifer Lynn Barnes (3.5/5 ⭐):  
A welcome return to the mystery/thriller elements that made the first book shine, after the romance-heavy second installment. This Sloane-centered story successfully converges several overarching plots while maintaining an engaging pace. An entertaining quick read that, while not reaching the heights of the series opener, delivered a solid middle-series installment.

**From _The Fox Wife_**

“I’ve progressed far enough down in this bitter path to see a little sunlight amid the thorns.”

**From _The Sword of Kaigen_**

“We’re water, and water can shift to fit any mold. No matter how we’re broken and reshaped, we can always freeze ourselves strong again.”

**From _All Systems Red_**

“murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.”

**From _Assassin's Apprentice_**

"I suppose you will learn, then. For I have a will that you will, even if you do not yet.”
