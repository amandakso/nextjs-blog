This was my first year taking part in the [r/Fantasy Bingo Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1bt4iqf/official_rfantasy_2024_book_bingo_challenge/), a yearly reading challenge within the fantasy subreddit community. Running from April 1st, 2024 to March 31st, 2025, the challenge encourages readers to explore diverse fantasy works through a bingo card of themed squares. The rules are straightforward: you can't use the same book for multiple squares or repeat authors (except for the short stories square). Only one square can be a reread, and you're allowed one substitution from a previous bingo card. The purpose of this challenge is to push readers beyond their comfort zones, discover new works, and maintain reading momentum throughout the year. My ambitious goal was to achieve a complete blackout, and I'm proud to say I nearly completed all squares in hard mode!

### The Bingo Card Breakdown

First Row Across:  
üü© 1. First in a Series: Read the first book in a series. HARD MODE: The series is more than three books long.

_Gideon and the Ninth_ by Tamsyn Muir  
Bingo Square Criteria: The Locked Tomb Series planned to have 4 books in the series plus one short story.  
Rating: 4.25/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
An anticipated read of mine that is a promising start to a series with a unique blend of necromancers, murder mystery and horror. I heard that each book in the series has a very different tone and am excited to see what is in store for future installments.

üü© 2. Alliterative Title: Read a book where multiple words in the title begin with the same letter. HARD MODE: The title has three words or more that start with the same letter.

_The Lies of Locke Lamora_ by Scott Lynch  
Bingo Square Criteria: 3 words starting with L in the title  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A plot forward, engaging heist novel. While I found the novel's intricate plotting impressive, with its cleverly interwoven dual timelines showing both the present-day cons and the protagonists' formative years under Chains' tutelage, the book hit some of my personal triggers so I won't be continuing with the series.

üü© 3. Under the Surface: Read a book where an important setting is either underground or underwater. HARD MODE: At least half the book takes place underground or underwater.

_A Letter to the Luminous Deep_ by Sylvie Cathrall  
Bingo Square Criteria: Mainly takes place underwater  
Rating: 2/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A collection of intriguing ideas drowning in overwritten prose and structural problems‚Äîa frustrating case of potential squandered by poor execution. I would have DNF'd if not for this bingo challenge, and I finished it right before the deadline, leaving no time to pick another book. I had high hopes going into this novel, but unfortunately found myself deeply disappointed. The premise initially grabbed me, but the execution fell flat in almost every aspect.

üü© 4. Criminals: Read a book in which the main character is a criminal. This could be a thief, assassin, someone who commits mail fraud, etc. HARD MODE: Features a heist.

_A Tempest of Tea_ by Hafsah Faizal  
Bingo Square Criteria: Teashop/ illegal blood house and a ragtag team commit a heist  
Rating: 2.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Severely disappointed by such a promising premise combining a teashop, vampires, and a heist. The plot dragged terribly, featuring lackluster characters, glaring plot holes, and overly verbose, flowery prose that even the BTS references and inspired character couldn't save.

üü© 5. Dreams: Read a book where characters experience dreams, magical or otherwise. HARD MODE: The dream is not mystical or unusual, just a normal dream or nightmare.

_The Book Eaters_ by Sunyi Dean
Bingo Square Criteria: The protagonist has dreams/nightmares  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
_The Book Eaters_ presents an intriguing premise - a race who consumes books to gain knowledge and sustenance. This unique story tackles weighty topics like antiquated traditions, the struggles of motherhood, generational trauma trauma, and ingrained misogyny in thought-provoking ways.

Second Row Across:  
üü© 6. Entitled Animals: Read a book that has an animal in the title. The animal in the title does not have to appear in the story. HARD MODE: The animal in the title is a fantasy or sci-fi creature.

_His Majesty's Dragon_ by Naomi Novik  
Bingo Square Criteria: Dragon in the title  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A super fun fantasy novel that reimagines the Napoleonic Wars with dragons as a crucial element of military strategy. I breezed through this novel and am looking forward to continuing the series.

üü© 7. Bards: Read a book in which the primary protagonist is a bard, musician, poet, or storyteller. HARD MODE: The character is explicitly called a bard.

_A River Enchanted_ by Rebecca Ross  
Bingo Square Criteria: One of the main protagonists, Jack, is a bard.  
Rating: 4.75/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
The combination of intriguing characters, political mystery, and magical elements, all set against a beautifully crafted backdrop, made this a truly engaging read.

üü© 8. Prologues and Epilogues: Read a book that has either a prologue or an epilogue. HARD MODE: The book must have both.

_Two Twisted Crowns_ by Rachel Gillig  
Bingo Square Criteria: Has both a prologue and epilogue  
Rating: 3.75/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
I didn't intend to use this book for the prompt, but discovered it contained both a prologue and epilogue. I enjoyed this conclusion to the duology more than the first book, as Elsepeth, who I found annoying, had a diminished role. While there were definite plot holes and the ending felt rushed and convenient, I appreciated this book for what it is: an entertaining romantasy, not a profound piece of literature.

üü© 9. Self-Published or Indie Publisher: Self-published or published through an indie publisher. If a formerly self-published novel has been picked up by a publisher, it only counts for this challenge if you read it when it while was still only self-published. HARD MODE: Self-published and has fewer than 100 ratings on Goodreads OR an indie publisher that has done an AMA with r/Fantasy.

_Sword of Kaigen_ by M.L. Wang  
Bingo Square Criteria: Traditionally published  
Rating: 5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Sadly, the only square where I believe I did not meet hard mode. I really struggled with finding a book for this prompt and only remembered after reading that this one is traditionally published. I'd been highly anticipating this book and finally got hold of a library copy. _The Sword of Kaigen_ completely swept me away with its masterful blend of elemental magic, political intrigue, and deeply emotional character relationships. At its heart, this standalone fantasy follows a mother and son whose lives are upended when their community faces an invasion, but it delivers so much more than a simple war story. The world-building captivated me through its intricate elemental magic system and the political complexities of an Empire built on secrets and deception. Looking forward to reading this author's more recent release, _Blood Over Bright Haven_.

üü© 10. Romantasy: Read a book that features romance as a main plot. This must be speculative in nature but does not have to be fantasy. HARD MODE: The main character is LGBTQIA+.

_Small Miracles_ by Olivia Atwater  
Bingo Square Criteria: Main protagonist is gender-fluid  
Rating: 3.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A delightfully quirky and lighthearted read centered around an unexpectedly hilarious premise: Gadriel, a fallen angel, is desperately trying to increase human sin to repay a gambling debt. Their unfortunate target is Holly, who proves maddeningly difficult to tempt, turning what could be a straightforward supernatural plot into a comedic challenge. An easy, quick read, _Small Miracles_ succeeds in providing both entertainment and moments of genuine character connection. The novel's blend of humor, supernatural elements, and family dynamics creates a unique reading experience that manages to be both light-hearted and subtly meaningful.

Third Row Across  
üü© 11. Dark Academia: Read a book that fits the dark academia aesthetic. This includes school and university, secret societies, and dark secrets. Does not have to be fantasy, but must be speculative. HARD MODE: The school itself is entirely mundane.

_Ninth House_ by Leigh Bardugo  
Bingo Square Criteria: Takes place at Yale  
Rating: 3.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
An interesting set up with secret societies at an Ivy League School, the pacing is particularly problematic, with the first half of the book dragging significantly. The book ultimately reads as a promising concept hampered by problematic execution in terms of pacing, character development, and narrative clarity.

üü© 12. Multi-POV: Read a book with at least three point of view characters. HARD MODE: At least five point of view characters.

_The Atlas Six_ by Olivie Blake  
Bingo Square Criteria: 6 Multi POVs  
Rating: 3.75/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
_The Atlas Six_ delivered a fun dark academic novel that I found to be an entertaining reading experience though it didn‚Äôt capitalize on the potential its intrigue premise held. I enjoyed being able to piece together the overarching mystery while reading from the multiple perspectives of the chosen six.

üü© 13. Published in 2024: A book published for the first time in 2024 (no reprints or new editions) First translations into your language of choice are allowed. HARD MODE: It's also the author's first published novel.

_Teller of Small Fortunes_ by Julie Leong  
Bingo Square Criteria: Debut novel published in Nov 2024  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A delightful cozy fantasy with Chinese element woven seemlessly throughout the story's lore, magic system and plot. The found family aspect of the story really warmed my heart, delivering exactly the kind of wholesome sweetness I look for in this genre. I noticed some clunkiness in the character motivations and occasionally heavy-handed plot developments, but these felt understandable for a debut novel. Despite these minor rough edges, it was overall a wonderfully sweet read that left me feeling content and satisfied.

üü© 14. Character with a Disability: Read a book in which an important character has a physical or mental disability. HARD MODE: A main character has a physical or mental disability.

_The Spear Cuts Through Water_ by Simon Jimenez  
Bingo Square Criteria: One of the main protagonists has a physical disability (without a left arm)  
Rating: 4.25/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
An incredible work that succeeds in creating a story that feels larger than life. While it may not have resonated with me on a deep emotional level, I found myself captivated by the author's skill in weaving this complex, mythic narrative.

üü© 15. Published in the 1990s: Read a book that was published in the 1990s. HARD MODE: The author, or one of the authors, has also published something in the last five years.

_Assassin's Apprentice_ by Robin Hobb  
Bingo Square Criteria: Published April 1995, has published short fiction in the last five years  
Rating: 5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Another highly anticipated series that did not let me down. While the novel takes its time establishing its world and characters, it successfully lays the groundwork for what promises to be an expansive and politically intricate series. Robin Hobb's _Assassin's Apprentice_ stands as a remarkable testament to enduring fantasy storytelling, proving that quality worldbuilding and character development remain compelling even decades after its 1990s publication.

Fourth Row Across  
üü© 16. Orcs, Trolls, and Goblins - Oh My!: Read a book featuring orcs, trolls, or goblins. HARD MODE: As a main character.

_Books and Bonedust_ by Travis Baldree  
Bingo Square Criteria: The main character Viv is an orc.  
Rating: 3.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Although _Bookshops & Bonedust_ didn't deliver quite the same level of warmth and comfort I found in _Legends & Lattes_, it still managed to be a quick, simple, and relatively cozy read. It's a decent book in its own right and a palette cleanser, even if it didn't quite live up to my expectations set by its companion novel.

üü© 17. Space Opera: Read a sci-fi book that features a large cast of characters and has a focus on social dynamics which may be political or personal in nature. Set primarily in space or on spaceships. HARD MODE: Written by an author of marginalized gender identity (e.g. women, trans people, non-binary people).

_All Systems Red_ by Martha Wells  
Bingo Square Criteria: Space opera novella  
Rating: 5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
I originally planned to use the Locked Tomb sequel for this prompt but realized I couldn't repeat authors. Luckily, I discovered this would also work and even satisfy hard mode. I love Murderbot, a delightfully relatable SecUnit who hacked its own system simply to binge-watch entertainment shows. Murderbot's aversion to social interaction and its humorous inner commentary completely captivated me, and I can't wait to continue with this series.

üü© 18. Author of Color: Read a book by an author of color. HARD MODE: Must be a debut novel published in the last five years.

_The Jasad Heir_ by Sara Hashem  
Bingo Square Criteria: Debut published July 2023 by Sara Hashem, an Egyptian American  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Despite having debut novel growing pains, I believe _The Jasad Heir_ sets up an interesting foundation for a fantasy world that showcases Hashem‚Äôs storytelling potential. While the novel‚Äôs flaws gave me pause at times, the slow burn romantic tensions and intriguing political machinations have me invested enough to continue this series.

üü© 19. Survival: Read a book in which the primary goal of the characters and story focuses on survival. Surviving an apocalypse, surviving a war, surviving high school, etc. HARD MODE: No superviruses or pandemics.

_Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir  
Bingo Square Criteria: Lone survivor on a spaceship  
Rating: 4.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
_Project Hail Mary_ by Andy Weir is an accessible sci-fi read with an interesting premise of what would happen if an alien life form depleted energy/light from our sun. We follow Ryland Grace, an academic and grade school teacher, who wakes from a coma in a different solar system with retrograde amnesia and follow his journey of survival on this spacecraft as he slowly regains his memories. For all its accessibility aimed at average readers, the oversimplified science hindered my ability to fully immerse myself in the story due to excessive suspension of disbelief required but overall a very enjoyable read,

üü© 20. Judge A Book By Its Cover: Choose because you like its cover. HARD MODE: Pick the book based only on the information available on the cover. No reading the blurb!

_Song of Silver Flame Like Night_ by Ameilie Wen Zhao  
Bingo Square Criteria: Chosen because of the stunning book cover  
Rating: 3/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
I was actually drawn to this book by the beautiful cover of its sequel. With this cover also being stunning, I decided to read it for the prompt. However, I was disappointed by the story within. My excitement about a novel centered on Chinese folklore quickly evaporated as I realized how superficially the culture was represented. What could have been a rich, nuanced exploration of Chinese folklore and culture turned out to be a watered-down, trope-filled narrative that felt like it was written more for a white audience than for anyone genuinely interested in the depth of the cultural elements it claimed to represent.

Fifth Row Across  
üü© 21. Set in a Small Town: The primary setting is a small town. HARD MODE: The small town can be real or fictional but the broader setting must be our real world and not a secondary world.

_The Ex Hex_ by Erin Sterling  
Bingo Square Criteria: Set in the fictional small town Graves Glen, Georgia  
Rating: 4/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A fun, spicy, and lighthearted read that perfectly captured the spooky fall atmosphere. t hit the spot as a perfect fall season read, offering just the right mix of romance, humor, and a touch of the supernatural. While it may not be a profound literary experience, it certainly fulfilled its role as an enjoyable, escapist romance with a magical twist.

üü© 22. Five SFF Short Stories: Any five short stories or novelettes. HARD MODE: Read an entire speculative anthology or collection.

_Exhalation_ by Ted Chiang  
Bingo Square Criteria: An anthology of 9 speculative short stories  
Rating: 4.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
Ted Chiang's _Exhalation_ is a remarkable collection of speculative short stories that challenge readers' perceptions through uniquely imaginative narratives. While short stories are outside of my confort zone, I have heard good things of this collection and was not disappointed. The standout story for me was "The Great Silence," told from a parrot's perspective - a brilliantly constructed narrative that explores communication, marginalization, and the silencing of voices often overlooked. While "Omphalos" was my least engaging story, centered around themes of faith, it still demonstrated Chiang's remarkable ability to construct intricate speculative worlds that challenge readers' assumptions. Overall would highly recommend the collection.

üü© 23. Eldritch Creatures: Read a book featuring a being that is uncanny, unearthly, and weird. This can be a god or monster from another plane or realm and is usually beyond mortal understanding. HARD MODE: The book is not related to the Cthulhu mythos.

_Sunbringer_ by Hannah Kaner  
Bingo Square Criteria:  
Rating: 3.5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
A rather lackluster sequel to what is apparently a trilogy. My expectations of this being the end of the duology made the cliffhanger ending especially frustrating. The found family aspect that I enjoyed in the first book was missing in this one given that the characters were separated for most of this book. A quick, rather straightforward read but not nearly as entertaining as its predecessor.

üü© 24. Reference Materials: Read a book that features additional material, such as a map, footnotes, glossary, translation guide, dramatis personae etc. HARD MODE: Book contains at least two types of additional materials.

_The Will of the Many_ by James Islington  
Bingo Square Criteria: Dramatis Personae, Glossary  
Rating: 5/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
_The Will of the Many_ was an absolutely fascinating, Roman-inspired fantasy depicting a very disturbing world in which people imbue and yield their will. The plot twists and political intrigue throughout this book was exceptionally written and gripping.

üü© 25. Book Club or Readalong Book: Any past or active r/Fantasy book clubs count as well as past or active r/Fantasy readalongs. See our full list of book clubs here. NOTE: All of the current book club info can also be found on our Goodreads page. Every book added to our Goodreads shelf or on this Google Sheet counts for this square. You can see our past readalongs here. HARD MODE: Must read a current selection of either a book club or readalong and participate in the discussion.

_The Spellshop_ by Sarah Beth Durst  
Bingo Square Criteria: Dec 2024 Book Club Book  
Rating: 4.25/5 ‚≠ê  
Mini Review:  
I was excited to see this book be selected for one of the book club reads and adored this charming cozy fantasy story. A low-stakes read with gentle magic, endearing characters, and lighthearted storytelling featuring a delightfully antisocial protagonist, her talking spider-plant assistant, and the found family they discover when they return to her hometown.
