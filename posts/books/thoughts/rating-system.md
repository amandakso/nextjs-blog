When we rate books on a 5-star scale, what are we actually saying? One reader's 3-star rating might be another's 4-star experience. As I continue to rate more and more books, I've found myself becoming increasingly thoughtful about how I assign those little stars, and I wanted to share my personal approach to ratings.

## My Star System Explained

First, some ground rules: I only rate books I've completed (no DNFs get stars), and I don't assign ratings to memoirs—it feels inappropriate to "grade" someone's life story they've chosen to share.
Over time, I've noticed myself becoming a more critical reader. Looking back at some of my earlier ratings, I often think, "I'd definitely rate that lower today." Our standards evolve as we read more widely, and that's perfectly normal.

### Breaking Down My Star Ratings

★☆☆☆☆ (1 Star): Books I actively disliked and cannot find redeeming qualities in. These are the "I want my time back" reads where the negatives completely overwhelmed any potential positives.  
★★☆☆☆ (2 Stars): Books I didn't enjoy but had at least one element that prevented them from being a complete disappointment. There's a glimmer of something worthwhile amid the frustration.  
★★★☆☆ (3 Stars): My most complex rating tier. These could be books that were merely "okay" without strong feelings either way, or books with excellent qualities counterbalanced by significant flaws. The reading experience was mixed.  
★★★★☆ (4 Stars): Books I genuinely enjoyed but that had noticeable imperfections that detracted from the overall experience. Great reads with room for improvement.  
★★★★★ (5 Stars): Not perfect books (no book is), but perfect for me. These hit all the right notes and created a reading experience I treasure.

I also use half and quarter stars to make finer distinctions between these main categories.

### What Influences My Ratings

Several factors consistently affect how I rate books:

- Character consistency (Do they behave in ways that make sense?)
- Writing style and prose (Is it engaging? Distracting? Beautiful?)
- Dialogue (I'm particularly sensitive to cringe-worthy or unrealistic conversations)
- Character motivations (Do I understand why people are doing what they're doing?)
- Storytelling and plot (Does the story flow sensibly and keep me engaged?)

### Genre Expectations Matter

My expectations vary significantly by genre. I tend to have higher standards for fantasy novels than for romance, for example. A 4-star romance and a 4-star fantasy might satisfy completely different criteria in my mind.
Depending on the genre, I might prioritize different elements—character development might be crucial in literary fiction, while pacing and plotting might take precedence in a thriller.

## Beyond Stars: Why Reviews Matter More

Just as I hope others don't judge my reading taste solely by star ratings, I rely more on written reviews than stars when choosing my next read. A thoughtful review (spoiler-free, please!) offers far more insight into whether a book might align with my preferences than a simple numerical value.
After all, one reader's 2-star disappointment might highlight exactly the elements I'm looking for in my next reading adventure.
