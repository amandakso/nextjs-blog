The literary world of 2025 promises an exciting array of new releases across multiple genres. With today's release of _Emily Wilde's Compendium of Lost Tales_, the bittersweet conclusion to one of my first and most beloved cozy fantasy series, I'm inspired to share the books I'm most looking forward to this year. This final installment, blending dark fae mythology with academic exploration and a delightful slow-burn romance between Emily and Wendell, marks the end of a truly special series. As I look ahead to the rest of 2025, here are the other stories that have caught my attention.

**Notable Recent Release**

_Water Moon_ by Samantha Sotto Yamba (January 14):
This unique story follows an inherited pawnshop owner who deals in people's regrets. The physical copy features an unique dust jacket that can be folded into an origami boat, mirroring the cover design. While I'm too protective of my copy to attempt the folding, I'm intrigued by how this artistic choice might tie into the narrative.

**Spring 2025**

_Sunrise on the Reaping_ by Suzanne Collins (March 18):
For longtime fans of _The Hunger Games_, this prequel promises to unveil the story of Haymitch's quarter quell. As someone who adored the original trilogy, I'm eager to return to Panem and witness this pivotal moment in the series' history.

_A Drop of Corruption_ by Robert Jackson Bennett (April 1):
Following the success of the series' first installment, this Sherlock-inspired fantasy continues to blend detective work with high fantasy elements. Set in a world of modified humans and Leviathan-like monsters, I'm excited to unravel the next mystery in this captivating series.

**Summer 2025**

_My Friends_ by Fredrik Backman (May 20):
Backman's extraordinary ability to craft emotionally resonant characters makes this upcoming release particularly exciting. This story of friendship promises the author's signature blend of humor and heart. I'm looking forward to the emotional journey that Backman's writing inevitably creates.

_Sounds Like Love_ by Ashley Poston (June 17):
This magical realism romance between a songwriter and musician caught my attention as I explore more contemporary romance. The musical element adds an intriguing layer to what promises to be a enchanting love story.

**Fall 2025**

_Katabasis_ by R.F. Kuang (August 26):
After the brilliance of _Babel_, Kuang returns with another dark academia novel. The premise—academic rivals journeying to hell to rescue their professor—combines scholarly intrigue with supernatural elements in what promises to be an intense adventure.

_The Strength of the Few_ by James Islington (September 1):
Following the Roman-inspired fantasy world established in _The Will of the Many_, this sequel promises to build upon the intense foundation of its predecessor. I devoured the first book and eagerly await discovering how the intricate plot unfolds.

**Winter 2025**

_Brigands & Breadknives_ by Travis Baldree (November 11):
While the prequel didn't quite capture the same magic as _Legends & Lattes_, I'm genuinely excited about this new installment that combines both a coffee shop and bookstore setting. The promise of returning to that perfect low-stakes coziness that made the original so special has me eagerly anticipating this release.

**Final Thoughts**

As I bid farewell to Emily Wilde's adventures, these upcoming releases offer new worlds to explore and stories to cherish. While my TBR list continues to grow exponentially, these particular books stand out as beacons of excitement throughout the year. Whether I read them on release day or discover them later, one thing remains certain: 2025 promises to be filled with compelling stories waiting to be discovered.
