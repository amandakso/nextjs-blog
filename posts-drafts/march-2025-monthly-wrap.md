#### Between the Pages: Reviews & Reflections

_The Lies of Locke Lamora_ by Scott Lynch (4/5 ⭐):  
Intricate, engaging heist novel with dual timelines that complement the story's plot. Well-crafted characters and storyline that left me satisfied with the standalone experience, though personal triggers prevent me from continuing the series.

_The Warm Hands of Ghosts_ by Katherine Arden (5/5 ⭐):  
Beautifully crafted narrative following two siblings during World War I that unfolds into a deeply moving exploration of trauma, grief, and unbreakable family bonds. Arden's storytelling shines in how she meticulously weaves together the siblings' journeys with beautiful prose and thoughtful narrative choices.

_Emily Wilde's Compendium of Lost Tales_ by Heather Fawcett (5/5 ⭐):  
A satisfying conclusion to one of my favorite cozy fantasy series. Masterfully balances high stakes and dark fae elements with comforting, cozy vibes. Emily and Wendell's witty banter remains a highlight, while the way previous narratives and characters are intertwined into this final installment creates a fulfilling conclusion.

_Us Against You_ by Fredrik Backman (4.25/5 ⭐):  
Explores the fallout from Beartown's tragic events through the complex responses of various townspeople, delivered with blunt yet poignant prose. The third-person narrative hints at future outcomes, creating an effectively foreboding atmosphere. Tackles complex issues including misogyny, homophobia, grief, death, assault, and team mentality in an unflinching manner that resonates deeply.

_We'll Prescribe You a Cat_ by Syou Ishida (3.5/5 ⭐):  
This Japanese translated work follows people seeking help at a unique clinic that prescribes cats as an unorthodox treatment method. While the wholesome message presents an encouraging story, I was most captivated by the magical realism and mystery surrounding the clinic rather than the individual character stories.

_His Majesty's Dragon_ by Naomi Novik (4/5 ⭐):  
A really fun dragon book set during the Napoleonic wars. The main character feels like a James Norrington type—a missed opportunity for a more compelling Will Turner figure instead. However, Temeraire the dragon absolutely steals the show and was an absolute delight to read.

_A Letter to the Luminous Deep_ by Sylvie Cathrall (2/5 ⭐):  
I should have DNF'ed this book. The premise initially grabbed me, but the execution fell flat. The epistolary format ended up as a collection of intriguing ideas drowning in overwritten prose and structural problems—a frustrating case of potential squandered by poor execution.

_First Love Language_ by Stefany Valentine (4.25/5 ⭐):  
Ended the month on a sweet note with this YA contemporary romance. Initially drawn by the stunningly pretty cover, I found the inside matched with a cute story that explores coming-of-age themes and racial identity alongside the romance.

### March Memorable Quotes

**From _The Warm Hands of Ghosts_**

"Armageddon was a fire in the harbor, a box delivered on a cold day. It wasn't one great tragedy, but ten million tiny ones, and everyone faced theirs alone."

"It was the poet's alchemy, to seize the intangible or unspeakable and drag it, real, into the living world."

**From _Emily Wilde's Compendium of Lost Tales_**

"I let out a trembling breath. 'And what sort of queen would that make me?' He looked perfectly earnest as he leaned in to kiss my cheek. 'Mine.'"

**From _Us Against You_**

"The truth about most people is as simple as it is unbearable: we rarely want what is best for everyone; we mostly want what's best for ourselves."

"Our sponaneous reactions are rarely our proudest moments. It's said that a person's first thought is the most honest, but that often isn't true. It's often just the most stupid."
